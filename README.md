## Treasure Island

# Instructions

Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program. 

[To write your code according to my story, you can use this flow chart from draw.io to help you.](https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Treasure%20Island%20Conditional.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1oDe4ehjWZipYRsVfeAx2HyB7LCQ8_Fvi%26export%3Ddownload)

However, I think the fun part is writing your *own* story 😊

That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...

# Escaping Characters

If you want to use multiple sets of quotes inside a single string, you might have to "escape" some of them using the backslash `\`. You can see this in my first sentence: 'You\'re at a crossroad...'.

# Extensions

Have a think about how you might write your program to make a player's answers less case-sensitive. In other words, your code should work regardless of whether your user answers "left" or "Left".

[You can also add your own ASCII art](https://ascii.co.uk/art). Just remember to add three single quotes `'''` at the start and at the end of your artwork to turn it into a multi-line string.
